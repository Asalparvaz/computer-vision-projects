## Computer Vision Projects

A growing collection of computer vision projects built while learning the fundamentals of visual modeling and image-based systems.

This repository documents my practical exploration of computer vision, working with visual data, and gradually building intuition through hands-on implementation.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Learn computer vision by building real projects
- Explore different types of vision problems
- Develop stronger intuition for how models process images
- Improve through iteration and experimentation

## 🧠 Approach

Each project focuses on understanding the problem, implementing a solution, evaluating results, and refining the approach.

The emphasis is on learning through doing, not on perfection.

## 🚀 Scope
Projects may include work on classification, detection, segmentation, or other visual tasks as my understanding expands.
